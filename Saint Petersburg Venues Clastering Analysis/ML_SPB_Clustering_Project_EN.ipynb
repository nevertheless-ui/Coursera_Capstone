    "## Introduction/Business Problem section\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior setting for this project is hypothetical restaurateurâ€™s request for market analysis. The well-known restaurateur decided to open a new venue in Saint Petersburg, Russia. It would be obvious suggestion that the most common place for it is the center of the city. Area is one of the most major aspect of the site selection as Russian cities are widely spaced along the land. Also, there are too many competitive restaurants may be placed there, so it is important to find the best possible place to get more profit for effective pay back.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of this project is to define better neighborhood for opening a new high cuisine restaurant based on points:\n",
    "1.\tFocus on customers with high-income\n",
    "2.\tTotal population of neighborhoods\n",
    "3.\tLess possible competitive venues along the area\n",

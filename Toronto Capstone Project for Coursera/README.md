# Coursera Capstone

This is public repo for the Machine Learning courses.
The goal of this lab - parsing web-data and assembling it into dataframe with geolocation coordinates to build
an appropriate clustering k-means model. It requires 3 steps.

Notes:
- made with Anaconda JupNotebooks Server
- you need credentials from Foursquare.com Dev API to implement it
